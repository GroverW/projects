                            Version one at least - it's looking pretty static right now.

                        <h2>Some things of note:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CSS Variables could be so useful. Gotta use them in the future</li>
                            <li>I was reminded of the days of PHP where you could set the root directory to a variable and use that to reference all your stylesheets / files instead of manually typing out paths. I know you can do ~/ to start from the root, but the root is not the same on localhost and web host. Maybe there's some other trick I need to figure out.</li>
                            <li>Learning to load content with JS and some backend code (Node?) sounds like it's going to be great as well.</li>
                            <li>Gotta make this look more professional at some point in the future.. maybe start a to-do list.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>I had a bunch more ideas about how to add features, like creating different layers that get swapped via a queue so you could mix colors / undo things. Ultimately I learned some of the limits of JS when it comes to styling divs based on mouseover - much more than a seven-bit grid (need to find a font with numbers or pay for this one haha) of divs and it starts to get pretty laggy (at least on my computer).</p>
                            <p>Compared to the <a href="../projects/rock-paper-scissors/index.html">Rock-Paper-Scissors</a> project, there were way fewer visual elements, and as a result way fewer hours / lines of code used for this one. Lesson learned for the future :).</p>

                            <p>Really basic app, but I was able to test a lot of different ideas, which resulted in some great leassons learned:</p>
