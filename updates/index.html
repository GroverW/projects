                            Version one at least - it's looking pretty static right now.

                        <h2>Some things of note:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CSS Variables could be so useful. Gotta use them in the future</li>
                            <li>I was reminded of the days of PHP where you could set the root directory to a variable and use that to reference all your stylesheets / files instead of manually typing out paths. I know you can do ~/ to start from the root, but the root is not the same on localhost and web host. Maybe there's some other trick I need to figure out.</li>
                            <li>Learning to load content with JS and some backend code (Node?) sounds like it's going to be great as well.</li>
                            <li>Gotta make this look more professional at some point in the future.. maybe start a to-do list.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>I had a bunch more ideas for features to add, like creating different layers that get swapped via a queue so you could mix colors / undo things. Ultimately I learned some of the limits of JS when it comes to styling divs based on mouseover - much more than a seven-bit grid (need to find a font with numbers or pay for this one haha) of divs and it starts to get pretty laggy (at least on my computer).</p>
                            <p>Compared to the <a href="../projects/rock-paper-scissors/index.html">Rock-Paper-Scissors</a> project, there were way fewer visual elements, and as a result way fewer hours / lines of code used for this one. Lesson learned for the future :).</p>

                            <p>Really basic app, but I was able to test a lot of different ideas, which resulted in some great leassons learned:</p>
                            <h2>Levenshtein Distance</h2>
                            <p>I used this to match what the user types against the words 'rock', 'paper' and 'scissors'. Originally this was a console based project, so I figured it would be a cool opportunity to practice something like that</p>
                            <p>It's a cool algorithm for measuring the distane between two strings. It has a nice dynamic programming algorithm (<a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/string/levenshtein-distance" target="blank">example</a>), that can be tweaked depending on how you want to make the comparison. I think I read something like this is used in spell checkers.</p>
                            <p>The gist:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Make a two-dimensional matrix with word A on top and word B on the left</li>
                                <li>Add one point (or whatever you want) if you have to delete an extra letter from word A</li>
                                <li>Add one point (or whatever you want) if you have to change a letter from word A to word B</li>
                                <li>Add zero points if the letter is present in both</li>
                                <li>Find the minimum sum to get from word A to word B</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Asynchronous Javascript</h2>
                            <p>Ok I spent way too much time on this one. Wwhen the computer makes its character selection, I originally wanted it to scroll through the different character protraits by turning the three classes on and off... I thought this would be a good opporunity to use setTimeout, but did not realize those functions are not run in order, only out of order with the regular code.</p>
                            <p>My next attempt was to use a promise.then().then() or something along those loines, but didn't have any better luck. I'm pretty confident that <strong>was</strong> one of the viable methods, but I'll come back to this later.</strong></p>
                            <p>Ultimately I just made the character highlight move from the player to the computer and wait something close to a second before displaying both characters and the result of each round. Makes it a little more dramatic I guess?</p>
                            <h2>Clean Code</h2>
                            <p>From <a href="https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript" target="blank">this</a> awesome article. I also bought the clean code book and hope to read it at some point</p>
                            <p>I got to practice and see the benefits of some clean code concepts. Though I don't think my code is clean at all there were a few concepts that made it way better than it would have been otherwise.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><u>Function arguments (two or fewer ideally)</u> - The idea is to greatly reduce the complexity when testing. I did my best on this one (I think I achieved it?). If I thought I needed more than two arguments, I tried to find another way to do it. Though there were a few methods that allowed any number of arguments because it looped through hopefuly identicle selectors.</li>
                                <li><u>Functions should do one thing</u> - This one I really noticed the benefits of. There were several methods that I reused over and over again in different contexts, and it felt so nice when I didn't feel like I needed to change anything.</li>
                                <li><u>Function names should say what they do</u> - I had to go back a few times and rename methods because I had a hard time coming up with the right descriptions, but this helped a lot when I had to go back and figure out what my code was doing.</li>
                                <li><u>Avoid mentail mapping</u> - Instead of using letters for variables, I tried to name the variables so I could figure out what they were for when I went back</li>
                                <li><u>Make objects have private members</u> - Uh, I briefly attempted to do this, but it's on my to-do list for future projects.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>There were others, but I think this is a good start!</p>
