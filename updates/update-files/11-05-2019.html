        <p>I had a bunch more ideas for features to add, like creating different layers that get swapped via a queue so you could mix colors / undo things. Ultimately I learned some of the limits of JS when it comes to styling divs based on mouseover - much more than a seven-bit grid (need to find a font with numbers or pay for this one haha) of divs and it starts to get pretty laggy (at least on my computer).</p>
        <p>Compared to the <a href="../projects/rock-paper-scissors/index.html">Rock-Paper-Scissors</a> project, there were way fewer visual elements, and as a result way fewer hours / lines of code used for this one. Lesson learned for the future :).</p>
