        <p>I got to try / figure out a lot more than I thought I would with this project. Initially I was ready to just get through it and on to the next until I started working through things. I don't think much of it was even relevant to this project, but it's great to find ways to test out and learn new things whenever you get the chance</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating custom HTML tags - I'm not sure if these would be helpful from an accessibility standpoint. But if so, I could see myself using them a lot more instead of wrapping everything in divs. Three easy parts:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure you have a dash in the tag name (e.g. book-shelf instead of shelf) so it's recognized as a custom element and doesn't conflict with any future tags.</li>
                <li>Extend one of the existing objects, and set the constructor to super(). I used HTMLElement. (class BookShelf extends HTMLElement)</li>
                <li>customElement.define('tag name',class) and bam! Done.</li>
            </ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Got a lot more practice with manipulating the DOM as well. Especially adding a delete link to an element which deletes the parent node.</p>
