        37 Essential JavaScript Interview Questions
      </a>. A session of failing and learning.

    <h3>
      What is the significance of, and reason for, wrapping the entire content of a JavaScript source file in a function
      block?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Scoping - variables will be scoped to that file, so that there are no collisions with
      variables in other files that might have the same name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> To add, it also allows for an easily referenceable (presumably shorter) alias for a
      global variable, like the jQuery <span class="inline-code">$</span>.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What is the significance, and what are the benefits, of including <span class="inline-code">'use strict'</span> at
      the beginning of a JavaScript source file?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> I don't remember too much about the details of <span class="inline-code">'use
        strict'</span>. I'm pretty sure certain actions that
      JavaScript would normally ignore, now become errors. I also believe that the <span
        class="inline-code">class</span> keyword differentiates itself from functions in part by
      using <span class="inline-code">'use strict'</span> as a default.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Makes debugging easier - code errors that would have been ignored will now generate errors or throw exceptions
        (ok got this one at least)</li>
      <li>Prevents accidental globals - without it, assigning a value to an undeclared variable automatically creates a
        global variable with that name. Now it throws an error</li>
      <li>Eliminates <span class="inline-code">this</span> coercion - without it, a null / undefined <span
          class="inline-code">this</span> gets coerced into a global (super interesting!)</li>
      <li>Disallows duplicate parameter values - nice!</li>
      <li>Makes eval() safer - I don't think I need to worry about this one since I probably shouldn't be using it
        anyway</li>
      <li>Throws error on invalid usage of <span class="inline-code">delete</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Consider the two functions below. Will they both return the same thing? Why or why not?
    </h3>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  function foo1()
  {
    return {
        bar: "hello"
    };
  }
  
  function foo2()
  {
    return
    {
        bar: "hello"
    };
  }
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> The first one should return the object. The second one should return before the
      object, so the result would be <span class="inline-code">undefined</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> They add that this behavior also argues for following the convention of placing an
      opening curly brace at
      the end of a line in JavaScript instead of the beginning of a new line. Seems to make sense!
    </p>
    <h3>What is <span class="inline-code">NaN</span>? What is its type? How can you reliably test if a value is equal to <span class="inline-code">NaN</span>?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> <span class="inline-code">NaN</span> means 'Not a Number', but paradoxically I think it's of type <span class="inline-code">number</span>.
      I'm not sure how to reliably test it... does <span class="inline-code">===</span> not work?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Looks like <span class="inline-code">===</span> doesn't work even if it's being compared to itself (just returns false). ES6 added 
      <span class="inline-code">Number.isNaN()</span> which is apparently pretty reliable.
    </p>
    <h3>What will the code below output? Explain your answer.</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  console.log(0.1 + 0.2);
  console.log(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3);
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Ok, I clicked on this one yesterday because I read it wrong and thought it was saying something else. Would have gotten it wrong anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Since numbers in JavaScript are all treated as floats, they may not always yield the expected result. 
      This one would print <span class="inline-code">0.30000000000000004</span> and <span class="inline-code">false</span>. Cool! Makes sense.
    </p>
    <h3>Discuss possible ways to write a function <span class="inline-code">isInteger(x)</span> that determines if <span class="inline-code">x</span> is an integer.</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> I've used <span class="inline-code">Math.floor(x) === x</span> in the past. I guess you could use <span class="inline-code">%</span> as well. 
      I think <span class="inline-code">parseInt()</span> should also work?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Derp, apparently ECMAScript 6 added <span class="inline-code">Number.isInteger()</span>. Also, there's some bit manipulation like
      <span class="inline-code">(x ^ 0) === x</span> (I'd like to practice that stuff more). Also, apparently <span class="inline-code">parseInt()</span> doesn't work for very large numbers.
    </p>
    <h3>In what order will the numbers 1-4 be logged to the console when the code below is executed? Why?</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  (function() {
    console.log(1); 
    setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000); 
    setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0); 
    console.log(4);
  })();
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> 1 - 4 - 3 - 2. The <span class="inline-code">setTimeout</span> ones get taken off the call stack and handled asynchronously by the event loop. They're only 
      executed once the call stack is empty, so they should go last, and the one waiting longer should go after the one with 0ms timeout.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Yea that's it.
    </p>
    <h3>Write a simple function (less than 160 characters) that returns a boolean indicating whether or not a string is a palindrome.</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  const isPalindrome = (str) => str === str.split('').reverse().join();
  const isPalindrome = (str) => str.split('').every((char, i) => char === str[str.length - 1 - i])
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      I guess I could add stuff to remove spaces or lower / uppercase all the letters, but should be able to do that in 160 chars too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> They pretty much did the first one, except they used a regex to replace whitespace and lowercased the letters.
    </p>
    <h3>Write a <span class="inline-code">sum</span> method which will work properly when invoked using either syntax below.</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  console.log(sum(2,3));  // Outputs 5
  console.log(sum(2)(3)); // Outputs 5
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Ok, so I think this either has to return a helper if it doesn't get enough arguments, or return the sum if it does.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  const sum = (...args) => {
    if(args.length > 1) {
      return args.reduce((sum, val) => sum += val, 0);
    }

    let vals = [...args];

    return (...args) => {
      vals.push(...args);
      return vals.length > 1
        ? vals.reduce((sum, val) => sum += val, 0)
        : helper;
    }
  }
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Haha, I guess if you only care about two numbers it's way simpler.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  function sum(x) {
    if (arguments.length == 2) {
      return arguments[0] + arguments[1];
    } else {
      return function(y) { return x + y; };
    }
  }
    </code></pre>
