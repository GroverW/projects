    <h3>
      What is a stateless component?
    </h3>
    <p>
      A stateless component is one that does not depend on any other "state" to produce a result, like the functional programming paradigm.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What is the difference between the equality operators <span class="inline-code">==</span> and <span class="inline-code">===</span>?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <span class="inline-code">==</span> will try to coerce the right side of the expression into the same type as the left side, so
      <span class="inline-code">1 == '1'</span> will be true, while <span class="inline-code">===</span> is strict equals and returns false.
      <span class="inline-code">==</span> is also what people seem to mostly make jokes about JavaScript for.

    <h3>
      What is the difference between an element and a component in React?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <b>My Answer:</b> what is an element?? hahah oops. Is that what a dumb component is considered? I only know components and containers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Their Answer:</b> It's a plain JavaScript object that represents a DOM node or component. They're pure and never mutated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok, I don't know how I feel about that question.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What is a stateful component in React?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I guess it must be one that utilizes state via <span class="inline-code">useState</span> or <span class="inline-code">this.state</span> or
      the redux store or whatever.
    </p>

    <h3>
      In which states can a Promise be?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Pending, Resolved or Rejected
    </p>

    <h3>
      What is the difference between the postfix <span class="inline-code">i++</span> and prefix <span class="inline-code">++i</span> increment operators?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Order of operations. <span class="inline-code">i++</span> happens after the expression it's apart of is executed, while <span class="inline-code">++i</span>
      is the same as saying <span class="inline-code">i += 1</span>. And Douglas Crockford says don't use either.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Create a function <span class="inline-code">batches</span> that returns the maximum number of whole batches that can be cooked from a recipe.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Ok so basically return either the smallest <span class="inline-code">Math.floor(availableIngredient / recipeIngredient)</span> or 0 if you don't have one of them.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  const batches = (recipe, available) => {
    let maxBatches = Infinity;

    for(let ingredient in recipe) {
      if(!available[ingredient]) return 0;

      const numBatches = Math.floor(available[ingredient] / recipe[ingredient]);
      maxBatches = Math.min(maxBatches, numBatches);
    }

    return maxBatches;
  }
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <b>Their Answer:</b> Wow theirs is much more concise.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  const batches = (recipe, available) => {
    Math.floor(
      Math.min(...Object.keys(recipe).map(k => available[k] / recipe[k] || 0));
    )
  }
    </code></pre>

    <h3>
      What does the following code evaluate to? <br />
      <span class="inline-code">typeof typeof 0</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <span class="inline-code">typeof 0</span> should be <span class="inline-code">'number'</span> which is string, so
      <span class="inline-code">typeof 'number'</span> should be <span class="inline-code">'string'</span>.
    </p>

    <h3>
      How do you clone an object in JavaaScript?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <b>My Answer:</b> Two ways I can think of (there are probably more) - for shallow copies either do
      <span class="inline-code">const obj2 = { ...obj1 }</span> or <span class="inline-code">Object.assign({}, obj1)</span>.
      If you want a deep copy you gotta do it recursively.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Their Answer:</b> I forgot about <span class="inline-code">JSSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))</span>, but as they point out,
      you can't copy functions or circular references. Another route is
      <span class="inline-code">Object.keys(obj).reduce((acc, key) => (acc[key] = obj[key], acc), {})</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interesting, I gotta look into this part <span class="inline-code">= obj[key], acc)</span>. I had always done it like
      <span class="inline-code">({ ...acc, key: obj[key] }), {}</span>.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Synchronous code gets executed in a blocking manner off the call-stack. So when the interpreter reaches a line of code (like a function), it places
      it on the call-stack, executes until it reaches another function or callback or whatever, pushes that one to the call-stack, and continues
      until it reaches the end of the function on top of the stack, which gets popped off and executed until the stack is empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asynchronous code starts on the call-stack, but gets immediately popped off and moved to the event loop, where any asynchronous calls (like api calls) are
      handled by web workers. Once complete, it gets moved to the event queue which waits until the call-stack is empty before popping functions from the queue
      back to the call-stack for execution.
    </p>

    <h3>
      How do you compare two objects in JavaScript?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Three ways I can think of - use <span class="inline-code">===</span> to see if it's literally the same object, use <span class="inline-code">JSON.stringify</span>
      to see if they have the same structure, or iterate through recursively to check each value against one another.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What is a cross-site scripting attack (XSS) and how do you prevent it?
    </h3>
    <p>
      XSS is when someone is able to inject JavaScript on your site to run on other people's computers. Generally I think it requires you allowing them to post
      data to the DB so that it can be viewed by others.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>My Answer:</b> Preventing it - sanitize input / output! I don't know much beyond escaping strings
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Their Answer:</b> Should have mentioned <span class="inline-code">textContent</span> over <span class="inline-code">innerHTML</span>
    </p>
