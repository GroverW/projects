    <h3>
      Consider the following code snippet:
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    var btn = document.createElement('button');
    btn.appendChild(document.createTextNode('Button ' + i));
    btn.addEventListener('click', function(){ console.log(i); });
    document.body.appendChild(btn);
  }
      </code></pre>
      (a) What gets logged to the console when the user clicks on "Button 4" and why? <br />
      (b) Provide one or more alternate implementations that will work as expected.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> I think it should log "5". Since <span class="inline-code">var</span> was used to
      declare the variable,
      it won't be block scoped and the same <span class="inline-code">i</span> should be used for all buttons. Since the
      loop will end
      once <span class="inline-code">i</span> is 5, all buttons should log 5. <br />
      A solution for this would be to use <span class="inline-code">let</span> instead of <span
        class="inline-code">var</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> They suggest some other things like declaring a new variable for each loop and
      using that, or using an IIFE around
      the event listener and pass <span class="inline-code">i</span> into it, or use an array and <span
        class="inline-code">forEach</span> method using the
      index for the event listener. <br />
      One thing of note is they talk about bonus points for knowing things like how execution contexts, variable
      objects, activation objects, and the internal "scope" property
      contribute to the closure behavior, so that's probably some good info to research.

    <h3>
      Assuming <span class="inline-code">d</span> is an "empty" object in scope, say: <br />
      <span class="inline-code">var d = {};</span> <br />
      ...what is accomplished using the following code?
    </h3>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  [ 'zebra', 'horse' ].forEach(function(k) {
    d[k] = undefined;
  });
        </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> I don't see much to say about this besides <span class="inline-code">d</span> now
      has two
      keys called <span class="inline-code">zebra</span> and <span class="inline-code">horse</span>. So you could
      check if those
      keys exist in the object with <span class="inline-code">if in</span>, or loop through those keys using <span
        class="inline-code">for in</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> JavaScript now marks those properties as "own properties" of the object. They add
      that <span class="inline-code">Object.keys</span>
      will retrieve those keys. You could say the same with some other object methods.

    <h3>
      What will the code below output to the console and why?
    </h3>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var arr1 = "john".split('');
  var arr2 = arr1.reverse();
  var arr3 = "jones".split('');
  arr2.push(arr3);
  console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));
  console.log("array 2: length=" + arr2.length + " last=" + arr2.slice(-1));
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Ok so this is a test of which methods modify the array directly, and which don't.
      <ol>
        <li>
          After the first line, <span class="inline-code">arr1</span> is now <span class="inline-code">['j', 'o', 'h',
            'n']</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          After the second line, I believe <span class="inline-code">.reverse()</span> mutates the array, so both
          <span class="inline-code">arr1</span> and <span class="inline-code">arr2</span> are now
          <span class="inline-code">['n', 'h', 'o', 'j']</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Third line, <span class="inline-code">arr3</span> is <span class="inline-code">['j', 'o', 'n', 'e',
            's']</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Fourth line, <span class="inline-code">arr1</span> and <span class="inline-code">arr2</span> are now
          <span class="inline-code">['n', 'h' ,'o' , 'j', ['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's']]</span>
        </li>
      </ol>
      So now I think the same thing gets logged, the length is 5, and last is <span class="inline-code">['j', 'o', 'n',
        'e', 's']</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> The thing I didn't mention is that <span class="inline-code">.reverse()</span>
      returns a reference to the array
      itself. I dunno if I could have confidently said that, but it would be required for my reasoning to work out.

    <h3>
      What will the code below output to the console and why?
    </h3>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  console.log(1 +  "2" + "2");
  console.log(1 +  +"2" + "2");
  console.log(1 +  -"1" + "2");
  console.log(+"1" +  "1" + "2");
  console.log( "A" - "B" + "2");
  console.log( "A" - "B" + 2);
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="inline-code">console.log(1 + "2" + "2");</span> - I'm not sure if the strings get coerced into
          numbers or not
          since they come after the number... I'll guess they don't and it's <span class="inline-code">"122"</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="inline-code">console.log(1 + +"2" + "2");</span> - If I'm right about the first one, then this
          has to be
          <span class="inline-code">"32"</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="inline-code">console.log(1 + -"1" + "2");</span> - Which would make this <span
            class="inline-code">"02"</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="inline-code">console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2");</span> - And <span class="inline-code">"112"</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="inline-code">console.log("A" - "B" + "2");</span> - I have no idea what happens when you try to
          subtract letters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="inline-code">console.log("A" - "B" + 2);</span> - Still no idea.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Wow I was expecting to be wrong on these. The last two are <span
        class="inline-code">"NaN2"</span>
      and <span class="inline-code">NaN</span>. I guess that makes sense.
