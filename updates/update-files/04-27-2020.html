      Let's start a streak of this. Answering questions from:

    <h3>
      What is a potential pitfall with using <span class="inline-code">typeof bar === "object"</span>
      to determine if <span class="inline-code">bar</span> is an object? How can this pitfall be avoided?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> This expression would be true whether
      <span class="inline-code">bar</span> were an array or an object.
      <span class="inline-code">instanceof</span> might work better in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> If <span class="inline-code">bar</span> were <span class="inline-code">null</span>
      it would also be considered an object. So you would have to include a check to see if it was not <span
        class="inline-code">null</span>.
      They mention it could be an <span class="inline-code">array</span>, so you need to do:
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  (bar !== null) && (bar.constructor === Object)
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <h3>
      What will the code below output to the console and why?
    </h3>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  (function(){
    var a = b = 3;
  })();

  console.log("a defined? " + (typeof a !== 'undefined'));
  console.log("b defined? " + (typeof b !== 'undefined'));
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Ok so the declaration in the IIFE is the equivalent of saying:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  b = 3;
  var a = b;
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      This makes <span class="inline-code">b</span> a global variable, and should not be scoped to the IIFE, whereas
      <span class="inline-code">a</span> should be undefined. So it should be false, and true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Just to add, when using <span class="inline-code">use strict</span> This 
      whole expression will result in <span class="inline-code">ReferenceError: b is not defined</span>. Which seems pretty useful.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What will the code below output to the console and why?
    </h3>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var myObject = {
    foo: "bar",
    func: function() {
        var self = this;
        console.log("outer func:  this.foo = " + this.foo);
        console.log("outer func:  self.foo = " + self.foo);
        (function() {
            console.log("inner func:  this.foo = " + this.foo);
            console.log("inner func:  self.foo = " + self.foo);
        }());
    }
  };
  myObject.func();
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> ugh <span class="inline-code">this</span> pointer stuff is hard. 
      I think the first two <span class="inline-code">console.log</span> will print "bar", but I can't quite explain
      why <span class="inline-code">this</span> in the inner and outer functions are different. 
      I think because it's only being defined in the outer function, but called in the inner function? The inner function 
      should have its own local <span class="inline-code">this</span>, while the outer function should get it 
      from <span class="inline-code">myObject</span>. For the inner function, it should print "undefined"
      and "bar" respectively. It doesn't have a local <span class="inline-code">self</span> and should take it from the outer function.
    </p>

      <strong>Their answer:</strong> ok, apparently I'm right but I don't know why. Gotta read that book 
      <a href="http://cdn.lxqnsys.com/03_You_Don%27t%20_Know_JS_this_&_Object_Prototypes.pdf">You Don't Know This</a>
