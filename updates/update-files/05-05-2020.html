    <h3>
      How do you add an element at the beginning of an array? How do you add one at the end?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> <span class="inline-code">arr.unshift()</span> to add to the beginning. 
      <span class="inline-code">arr.push()</span> to add to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Cool, they added that you can use the spread operator, which might look like: 
      <span class="inline-code">myArray = ['start', ...myArray, 'end']</span>, which is more of a functional programming 
      style. I like that!
    </p>

    <h3>
      Imagine you have this code:
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var a = [1, 2, 3];
      </code></pre>
      a) Will this result in a crash?
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  a[10] = 99;
      </code></pre>
      b) What will this output?
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  console.log(a[5]);
      </code></pre>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> That will work fine. JavaScript will fill in all the missing indices with <span class="inline-code">undefined</span>. 
      So i guess that kinda answers both parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Ah interesting. So they won't actually be 'filled' with <span class="inline-scode">undefined</span>. 
      Those indices actually will be <span class="inline-code">undefined</span>, so a method like <span class="inline-code">arr.map()</span> 
      won't output those values.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What is the value of <span class="inline-code">typeof undefined === typeof NULL</span>?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Not really sure. I don't know what either of those produce, but the result of each is a string I believe, 
      so as long as they have the same type it should work?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Went a little too quickly there. <span class="inline-code">NULL</span> isn't the same as 
      <span class="inline-code">null</span>, it would actually be considered an undefined variable, so the expression would be true. Also, 
      <span class="inline-code">typeof null</span> is 'object', and <span class="inline-code">typeof undefined</span> is 'undefined'.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What would following code return?
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  console.log(typeof typeof 1);
      </code></pre>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Sweet, this falls in line with what I was talking about in the last one. Should be 'string'.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Yes indeed.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What will the following code output and why?
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var b = 1;
  function outer(){
        var b = 2
      function inner(){
          b++;
          var b = 3;
          console.log(b)
      }
      inner();
  }
    outer();
          </code></pre>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Looks like another hoisting question. <span class="inline-code">var b = 2</span> would override 
      <span class="inline-code">var b = 1;</span>. In the inner function, <span class="inline-code">var b</span> would be 
      hoisted to the top and override the outer <span class="inline-code">b</span>, then <span class="inline-code">b++</span> would 
      do nothing because it's undefiend at that point until it gets assigned to 3, so the final log should be 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Yea, and I guess their code makes it more clear what's going on in the inner function.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  function inner () {
    var b; // b is undefined
    b++; // b is NaN
    b = 3; // b is 3
    console.log(b); // output "3"
  }
    </code></pre>
