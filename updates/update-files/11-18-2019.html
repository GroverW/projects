            Version one at least - it's looking pretty static right now.

        <h2>Some things of note:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS Variables could be so useful. Gotta use them in the future</li>
            <li>I was reminded of the days of PHP where you could set the root directory to a variable and use that to reference all your stylesheets / files instead of manually typing out paths. I know you can do ~/ to start from the root, but the root is not the same on localhost and web host. Maybe there's some other trick I need to figure out.</li>
            <li>Learning to load content with JS and some backend code (Node?) sounds like it's going to be great as well.</li>
            <li>Gotta make this look more professional at some point in the future.. maybe start a to-do list.</li>
        </ul>
