      Getting into the mediums - I came up with a pretty bad solution for this. Should have spent more time looking at some examples for a pattern. Basically, 
      I just came up with some rules and otherwise did the actual comparison - If m is 0, then obviously there will be no matching bits, 
      and if there's a power of 2 within the range there will also be no matching bits, since a power of 2 doesn't match any bits 
      with the number previous to it.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var rangeBitwiseAnd = function(m, n) {
    if(!m) return 0;
    
    for(let i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        let num = 1 << i;
        if (num > m && num < n) return 0;
    }
    
    let result = m;
    for(let i = m + 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result &= i;
    }
    
    return result;
  };

    Could have put more thought into that... A better idea would be to look at some sample numbers, 
    let's say between 17 - 31:
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="inline-code">1 0 0 0 1</span> - 17<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1 0 0 1 0</span> - 18<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1 0 0 1 1</span> - 19<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1 0 1 0 0</span> - 20<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1 0 1 0 1</span> - 21<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1 0 1 1 0</span> - 22<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1 0 1 1 1</span> - 23<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1 1 0 0 0</span> - 24<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1 1 0 0 1</span> - 25<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1 1 0 1 0</span> - 26<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1 1 0 1 1</span> - 27<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1 1 1 0 0</span> - 28<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1 1 1 0 1</span> - 29<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1 1 1 1 0</span> - 30<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1 1 1 1 1</span> - 31
  </p>

    Looks like the only bits common between any two ranges are the starting bits, 
    so it appears I need to turn the right-most bits into 0s until the numbers are the same. One way 
    to do that would be to set them to 0 with like <span class="inline-code">m & ~(1 << i)</span>, and the other 
    way would be something like pushing them off and adding 0s back on.
    
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var rangeBitwiseAnd = function(m, n) {
    let numZeros = 0;

    while(m !== n) {
      m >>= 1;
      n >>= 1;
      numZeros++;
    }

    return m <<= numZeros;
  };

    Gotta figure out what letters / strings look like in binary. 
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14430633/how-to-convert-text-to-binary-code-in-javascript">
      Stack Overflow
    </a>
    says I gotta do basically <span class="inline-code">letter.charCodeAt(0)</span>. If I were using regular JS methods 
    to compare them, I'd probably use a hash map for each string which would be O(m) to create, O(m) to compare, and O(n^2) 
    to compare each of them with each other??? That seems bad.
  </p>
  <p>
    I can't think of a reason you wouldn't have to compare each word with each other letter by letter, so here goes.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var maxProduct = function(words) {
    let lookup = {};
    let maxProd = 0;

    for(let word of words) {
      lookup[word] = new Set([...word])
    }

    for(let i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++) {
      for(let j = i + 1; j < words.length; j++) {
        const prod = words[i].length * words[j].length;
        if (prod > maxProd) {
          if(different(words[i], words[j], lookup)) maxProd = prod;
        }
      }
    }

    return maxProd;
  };

  var different = function(word1, word2, lookup) {
    let shorter = word1.length < word2.length ? word1 : word2;
    let longer = word1.length < word2.length ? word2 : word1;

    for(let char of shorter) {
      if(lookup[longer].has(char)) return false;

    return true;

    How the hell do I translate this into bit manipulation... I can <span class="inline-code">XOR</span> to check if 
    two letters are the same. If I union one word with itself, I could <span class="inline-code">AND</span> a letter 
    with it to see if those bits all exist, but couldn't the bits for a letter be created by different letters combined?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="inline-code">1100001</span> - a<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1100010</span> - b<br />
    <span class="inline-code">1100011</span> - c<br />
  </p>
  <p>So yea, that won't work. Ok, I've spent too much time on this</p>
  <p>HAH! Ok the solution is super clever. A letter could be represented by a number from 0-25, which could represent 
    one of the first 26 bits of a 32-bit number. Then, to see if two words have any commonality, you can 
    <span class="inline-code">AND</span> their bit representations.

    Wow, that's also way faster than using strict string comparison. Really interesting to know. 
    It's like a super efficient set or something.

    Well apparently you should know hex to do this cleanly. Mask all the odd bits with 10101010,
