      On a side note... I need to update the layout for this site. And maybe some damn pagination.

    <h3>
      What will the following code output to the console and why:
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var hero = {
    _name: 'John Doe',
    getSecretIdentity: function (){
        return this._name;
    }
  };
  
  var stoleSecretIdentity = hero.getSecretIdentity;
  
  console.log(stoleSecretIdentity());
  console.log(hero.getSecretIdentity());
      </code></pre>
      What is the issue with this code and how can it be fixed.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> <span class="inline-code">this</span> doesn't refer to anything when it's called from
      <span class="inline-code">stoleSecretIdentity</span>, so that first output would be <span
        class="inline-code">undefined</span>.
      You'd need to do something like <span class="inline-code">var stoleSecretIdentity =
        hero.getSecretIdentity.bind(hero)</span> to
      maintain the correct <span class="inline-code">this</span> context.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Bam, nailed it.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Create a function that, given a DOM Element on the page, will visit the element itself and all of its descendants
      (not just its immediate children). For each element visited, the function should pass that element to a provided
      callback function. <br />
      The arguments to the function should be:
      <ul>
        <li>a DOM element</li>
        <li>a callback function (that takes a DOM element as its argument</li>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Could do this iteratively or recursively. Let's go with recursive! The annoying thing
      about accessing
      DOM children is that they're one of those array-like data structures that are clumsy to work with.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  const forEachDOMElement = (node, callback) => {
    callback(node);
    
    for(let i = 0; i < node.children.length; i++) {
        forEachDOMElement(node.children[i], callback)
    }
  }
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Pretty much the same except no ES6.

    <h3>
      Testing your <span class="inline-code">this</span> knowledge in JavaScript: What is the output of the following
      code?
    </h3>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var length = 10;
  function fn() {
    console.log(this.length);
  }
  
  var obj = {
    length: 5,
    method: function(fn) {
      fn();
      arguments[0]();
    }
  };
  
  obj.method(fn, 1);
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Man this is tough. I think the first log where just call <span
        class="inline-code">fn()</span> should
      be <span class="inline-code">undefined</span> because it's too many levels deep. I have a feeling <span
        class="inline-code">arguments[0]()</span>
      will be 5, but I don't know why.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Sooo far off. So the first one is 10, because when it's passed as a parameter its
      context becomes <span class="inline-code">window</span>,
      and <span class="inline-code">window.length</span> refers to <span class="inline-code">var length = 10</span> -
      HUH??? <br />
      Ok continuing on, when it's called by <span class="inline-code">arguments[0]()</span>, it's now referring to the
      <span class="inline-code">arguments</span>
      object, which is some dumb pseudo-array, and it has a length property which is 2 because 2 arguments were passed
      in to
      <span class="inline-code">object.method</span> when it was called. Geeeeeeeze - gotta read that book
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Dont-Know-JS-Prototypes/dp/1491904151">You Don't Know Js: this & Object
        Prototypes</a>.

    <h3>
      Consider the following code. What will the output be, and why?
    </h3>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  (function () {
    try {
        throw new Error();
    } catch (x) {
        var x = 1, y = 2;
        console.log(x);
    }
    console.log(x);
    console.log(y);
  })();
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Hmmmm I don't know how scoping works with <span class="inline-code">try / catch</span>
      blocks. I'm guessing
      <span class="inline-code">x</span> and <span class="inline-code">y</span> are still scoped to the function and
      it'd log 1 and 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Ehhhh whoops. I missed the third log. Interesting answer though. Apparently it's
      <span class="inline-block">1</span>, <span class="inline-block">undefined</span> and <span
        class="inline-block">2</span>. Apparently
      it's the equivalent of:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  (function () {
    var x, y; // outer and hoisted
    try {
        throw new Error();
    } catch (x /* inner */) {
        x = 1; // inner x, not the outer one
        y = 2; // there is only one y, which is in the outer scope
        console.log(x /* inner */);
    }
    console.log(x);
    console.log(y);
  })();
    </code></pre>

    <h3>
      What will be the output of this code?
    </h3>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var x = 21;
  var girl = function () {
      console.log(x);
      var x = 20;
  };
  girl ();
        </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Unfortunately, I think I remember seeing the answer to this. Inner <span
        class="inline-code">x</span> declaration gets
      hoisted to the top of the function and <span class="inline-code">undefined</span> gets logged (value doesn't get
      set until after the log).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Yea.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      How do you clone an object?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Could use the spread operator. I know there are some like <span
        class="inline-code">Object.assign()</span> method
      or something but I'd need to look it up. The problem is that this is only a shallow clone. To deep clone you'd
      have to do it recursively,
      or if you don't have any functions in there you could do <span
        class="inline-code">JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object))</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Yea, they went with <span class="inline-code">Object.assign()</span>
    </p>

    <h3>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() { console.log(i); }, i * 1000 );
  }
      </code></pre>
      What will this code print?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Methinks it will be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 since they're using <span class="inline-code">let</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Ok yea.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What do the following lines output, and why?
    </h3>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  console.log(1 < 2 < 3);
  console.log(3 > 2 > 1);
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> <span class="inline-code">1 < 2</span> is true (or 1), so it becomes <span class="inline-code">1 < 3</span> 
      which is also true, so it should log <span class="inline-code">true</span>. <br />
      <span class="inline-code">3 > 2</span> is true (or 1), so the second one becomes <span class="inline-code">1 > 1</span> which is false. 
      So <span class="inline-code">false</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Yes.
