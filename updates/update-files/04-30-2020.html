    <h3>
      The following recursive code will cause a stack overflow if the array list is too large.
      How can you fix this and still retain the recursive pattern?
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var list = readHugeList();

  var nextListItem = function() {
      var item = list.pop();
  
      if (item) {
          // process the list item...
          nextListItem();
      }
  };
      </code></pre>

      <strong>My answer:</strong> I have no idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var list = readHugeList();

  var nextListItem = function() {
    var item = list.pop();

    if (item) {
        // process the list item...
        setTimeout( nextListItem, 0);
    }
  };
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Ok so they move it off the call stack and process it asynchronously - so it moves to a queue instead of being on a
      stack.
      This seems really implementation specific.. I'm not sure I understand how this would process everything in the
      correct order if you were
      relying on a stack to begin with.

      <i><strong>Update 05-04-2020:</strong>
      Coindicentally, I worked on a project over the weekend, and was trying to figure out
      why <span class="inline-code">requestAnimationFrame</span> could call a function recursively 60 times a second and
      not stack overflow. Turns out this is the exact reason why. So I'm a dummy and I love that this showed up so quickly.</i>

    <h3>
      What is a "closure" in JavaScript? Provide an example.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> A closure is the ability for an inner function to remember the details of it's outer
      function long after that
      outer function has been executed.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  const counter = () => {
    let num = 0;

    const increment = () => {
      const currCount = num;
      num++;

      return currCount;
    }

    return increment;
  }

  let count = counter();  // undefined
  count()                 // 0
  count()                 // 1
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> So all they say is that a closure is an inner function that has access to the
      variables
      in the outer (enclosing) function's scope chain. Nothing about having access to it after the outer scope has been
      executed.
      Maybe there's another part to closure I don't know about.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var globalVar = "xyz";

  (function outerFunc(outerArg) {
      var outerVar = 'a';
      
      (function innerFunc(innerArg) {
      var innerVar = 'b';
      
      console.log(
          "outerArg = " + outerArg + "\n" +
          "innerArg = " + innerArg + "\n" +
          "outerVar = " + outerVar + "\n" +
          "innerVar = " + innerVar + "\n" +
          "globalVar = " + globalVar);
      
      })(456);
  })(123);

  // outerArg = 123
  // innerArg = 456
  // outerVar = a
  // innerVar = b
  // globalVar = xyz

    <h3>
      What will be the output of the following code:
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() { console.log(i); }, i * 1000 );
  }
      </code></pre>
      Explain your answer. How could the use of closures help here?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> It's going to log "5" each time. This is similar to that previous problem, where using
      <span class="inline-code">var</span> in a loop that doesn't display the value immediately runs into issues. Looks
      like
      they want you to use an IIFE and pass <span class="inline-code">i</span> in as a parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Yep.
    </p>


    <h3>
      What would the following lines of code output to the console?
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  console.log("0 || 1 = "+(0 || 1));
  console.log("1 || 2 = "+(1 || 2));
  console.log("0 && 1 = "+(0 && 1));
  console.log("1 && 2 = "+(1 && 2));
      </code></pre>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Guarding and Short-Circuiting. So we got the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="inline-code">console.log("0 || 1 = "+(0 || 1));</span> - 0 is falsey, so it should default to 1
          and log
          <span class="inline-code">"0 || 1 = 1"</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="inline-code">console.log("1 || 2 = "+(1 || 2));</span> - 1 is truthy? Anyway, it should stop at 1
          and log
          <span class="inline-code">"1 || 2 = 1"</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="inline-code">console.log("0 && 1 = "+(0 && 1));</span> - 0 is falsey, so it doesn't make it to 1
          and logs
          <span class="inline-code">"0 && 1 = 0"</span> I think, though I'm not sure if it would actually log false or
          undefined or something.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="inline-code">console.log("1 && 2 = "+(1 && 2));</span> - Same as before, it logs
          <span class="inline-code">"1 && 2 = 2"</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Yep.
    </p>


    <h3>
      What will be the output when the following code is executed? Explain.
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  console.log(false == '0')
  console.log(false === '0')
      </code></pre>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Got about 80% certainty on this one. For the first, JS should attempt to
      coerce <span class="inline-code">'0'</span> into <span class="inline-code">false</span>, which should work so I
      think it
      will return <span class="inline-code">true</span>. <br />
      For the second one, it can't coerce so it returns <span class="inline-code">false</span> I hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Got it.
    </p>


    <h3>
      What is the output of the following code? Explain your answer.
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var a={},
  b={key:'b'},
  c={key:'c'};
  
  a[b]=123;
  a[c]=456;
  
  console.log(a[b]);
      </code></pre>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> It's <span class="inline-code">123</span>. The key for an object gets stringified. I
      think the key
      would actually be <span class="inline-code">"{key:'b'}"</span> though.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> I'm wrong. So apparently they'd actually get stringified to
      <span class="inline-code">"[object Object]"</span>, which means <span class="inline-code">a[c]=456</span> would
      overwrite
      <span class="inline-code">a[b]=123</span> and the result would be <span class="inline-code">456</span>
    </p>


    <h3>
      What will the following code output to the console:
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  console.log((function f(n){return ((n > 1) ? n * f(n-1) : n)})(10));
      </code></pre>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Looks like this would basically return <span class="inline-code">n!</span>,
      so <span class="inline-code">3628800</span>. Base case is 1, beyond that all the numbers are just being multiplied
      together
      recursively.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Yes.
    </p>


    <h3>
      Consider the code snippet below. What will the console output be and why?
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">
  (function(x) {
    return (function(y) {
        console.log(x);
    })(2)
  })(1);
      </code></pre>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>My answer:</strong> Ok so <span class="inline-code">y</span> isn't being used at all looks like.
      <span class="inline-code">x</span> should just take its value from what's being passed in to the outer function,
      which is 1.
      So 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Their answer:</strong> Yes.
